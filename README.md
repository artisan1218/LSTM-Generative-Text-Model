# LSTM-Generative-Text-Model

LSTM generative text model will mimic the writing style of poet Bertrand Russell.

Again, for the consideration of computational power and runtime efficiency, LSTM will learn character by character instead of word by word of the published articles.

The books used are 
1. MYSTICISM AND LOGIC AND OTHER ESSAYS (MLOE)
2. THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (TAM)
3. The Problems of Philosophy (TPP)
4. Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in Philosophy (OKEWFSMP)

LSTM at the end will be given a starting string of text and keep writing to the text character by character until it reaches the pre-defined length. It will use previous texts to predict/mimic the next most possible character.

The following are the generated text.
